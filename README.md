# Frontend for a content management system currently in development.

This is a MERN-based content management system with extensibility that includes the management of posts and comments. It integrates with a backend API that delivers the stored posts, comments and authentication flow via MongoDB. Built from scratch from the ground up to practise fundamental React concepts.
